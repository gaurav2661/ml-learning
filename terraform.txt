Let me explain each major component in detail:

Configuration Processing:

HCL/JSON parsing validates syntax and evaluates expressions
Variable processing handles multiple sources (environment, tfvars, CLI)
Module processing downloads, verifies versions, and validates module configurations


Provider Management:

Downloads required providers based on configuration
Sets up authentication, regions, and API endpoints
Initializes gRPC channels for provider communication
Validates provider capabilities


State Management:

Handles both local and remote backend configurations
Implements state locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications
Performs state operations (read/write/backup)
Manages state versioning and history


Resource Graph:

Analyzes dependencies (explicit, implicit, and data source)
Validates graph for cycles and reference integrity
Plans execution order (parallel vs sequential operations)


Plan Generation:

Analyzes current state and detects drift
Determines necessary changes (create/update/delete/replace)
Generates both human-readable and machine-readable plans
Validates changes against provider capabilities


Apply Process:

Performs pre-operation checks
Executes operations through provider APIs
Handles state updates and output values
Implements error handling and rollback mechanisms



Key Implementation Details:

Provider Protocol:

Uses gRPC for provider communication
Implements capability checking
Handles provider versioning
Manages provider lifecycle


State Handling:

Implements optimistic locking
Handles state migrations
Manages state backups
Implements state refresh operations


Dependency Resolution:

Uses directed acyclic graph (DAG)
Handles both explicit and implicit dependencies
Manages cross-resource references
Implements data source dependencies


Error Handling:

Implements partial state updates
Handles provider errors
Manages cleanup operations
Provides detailed error messages
