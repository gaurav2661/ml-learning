### ASSUMPTIONS OF LINEAR REGRESSION
````
Let me explain the key assumptions of linear regression that need to be met for the model to be reliable:

Linearity

There should be a linear relationship between the independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (Y)
Can be checked using scatter plots and residual plots


Independence of Observations

Each observation should be independent of other observations
No significant correlation between successive residuals (no autocorrelation)


Homoscedasticity (Equal Variance)

The variance of residuals should be constant across all values of independent variables
Can be verified using residual plots against predicted values


Normality of Residuals

The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed
Can be checked using Q-Q plots or histogram of residuals


No Multicollinearity

Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other
Can be checked using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or correlation matrix


No Significant Outliers

Extreme values can significantly impact the regression line
Can be identified using standardized residuals or Cook's distance


Large Enough Sample Size

Sample should be large enough to achieve reliable results
Generally, at least 10-20 observations per predictor variable



Would you like me to elaborate on any of these assumptions or explain how to test for them in practice?
